I use this coding sample to illustrate my STATA coding techniques and characteristic variable construction skills. Based on Japan ’s prefecture-level panel data on digitalization development from 2011 to 2019, I empirically analyze the impacts of digitalization development and digitalization spillover effects on Japan ’s prefectural economic activities. 

I utilize the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method for constructing the digitalization development index and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs, not shown in this STATA coding sample) for measuring the direction of digitalization spillover effects , empirically investigate the impacts of digitalization development and digitalization spillover on economic performance. After benchmark OLS regression with fixed effects, I used total production instead of GDP per capita to conduct the robustness test, tested the endogeneity with availability rate of high-speed Internet in primary schools and 2SLS method, and developed two further mechanism tests with population aging and industrial structure.

The result of the analysis could be found in my writing sample, "Does Digitalization Spillover Negatively Influence the Economy? Empirical Evidence from Japan". Full work is available [here](https://leonequ.github.io/files/Digitalization.pdf).
